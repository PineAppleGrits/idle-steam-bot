## Simple Questions

**Do i get Vacban or is a Cheat?**
- No, this bot is used with **Steam Modules & NODEJS**, it's the same as **Steam Auth App** for your Windows, the difference is that Simulate the games.

**Is this Bot saving Information about my Account?**
- No, You can only enter your **Username** and **Password** into the Console Prompt, this details are secure, and nobody can get them. (Session Mode).

**Have the Creator or the Community Access?**
- No, this Bot is running in your **Localhost** (your pc) and your details cannot be Tracked.



## Let's Beggin

Install the NodeJs from https://nodejs.org/en/

Open your **CMD Prompt** and install the bellow modules inside the same folder as the bot is.

Use **npm** to install the necessary  modules:

npm install steam-user

npm install steamcommunity

npm install fs

npm install readline-sync

npm install request

npm install chalk

## Let's Start the bot

- To add **new games** go to the appbot.js file on line **"games": [739630]** and change the "739630" with game codes by "739630, 739630, 739630".
- You can get them from the link when you search a game on market http://steamcommunity.com/app/730 -> **730** ==  CS:GO.
(I'm going to change this in the future, a new way to insert them using Console).


Use **node appBot.js** to start your bot
